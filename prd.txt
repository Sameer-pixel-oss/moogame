1. Objective
Guide a realistic cow across unevenly spaced tower-islands in a side-scrolling ocean world.

The cow moves forward automatically.

Players use their voice to jump.

Survive 1 minute while avoiding obstacles.

2. Game Duration
Each round lasts 60 seconds.

If the player survives, they see a Victory Screen.

If they fall in the ocean or hit an obstacle, Game Over early.

3. Controls
Microphone Input (decibel-based):

0–44 dB → Cow walks forward normally.

≥45 dB → Cow jumps.

Louder = higher jump arc.

4. Core Gameplay
Cow walks automatically at steady pace.

Player must yell/shout “Moo” (or any loud sound).

The louder the sound → the higher the cow leaps.

Land safely on green tower-islands to continue.

Obstacles (thorns, nails, spikes, etc.) appear on some islands:

Hitting obstacle = Game Over.

5. Environment Design
Perspective: Side-view 2D platformer.

Ocean: Wide blue strip as base.

Islands: Green tower-like blocks with brown bases, randomly spaced.

Obstacles: Spikes, nails, thorny bushes (on top of islands).

6. Game Rules
Unequal distance between islands (randomly spaced).

At least 10 obstacles must appear during a 1-minute session.

Touching water = fail.

Touching obstacle = fail.

Survive full 60s = win.

7. Scoring & Feedback
Score = number of islands successfully crossed.

Bonus points for clearing obstacle-heavy islands.

HUD Elements:

Timer (countdown from 60s).

Score (top-center).

Mic volume bar (bottom).

8. Visual Style
Cow: Realistic sprite (cartoon-realism blend).

Islands: Varying widths, topped with grass.

Ocean: Flat blue base with slight wave animation.

Obstacles: Sharp, spiky shapes (visible but not distracting).

9. Difficulty & Ragebait Features
Unequal gaps → sometimes easy, sometimes almost impossible.

Random obstacle placement keeps players guessing.

Voice sensitivity makes overshooting common.

“Fail” animations:

Splash + sad moo when cow falls.

Ouch animation when cow hits spikes.

10. Technical Plan (Cursor Build)
HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript → core game loop.

Web Audio API → capture mic input (decibel detection).

Game Loop →

Update cow position + jump height.

Spawn islands + obstacles.

Detect collisions (island, obstacle, ocean).

Update timer + score.

Random Generation:

Unequal distance between islands.

At least 10 obstacles placed randomly.

Storage: Local best score (using localStorage).

Deployment: GitHub Pages.
